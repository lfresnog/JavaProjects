# Java Project 

The principal idea, is create a platform were different users can buy and sell different products.

## Versions

### V1

I started this idea trought the implementation of arrays, but when i tried to link it with my users, started to give me a lot problems, also, the use of arrays make the code too big and complicated. So, following the tips and help of my schoolmates, I decided to make it, with the new variable that we have seen with Alfonso, arrayList. I think that works well, but in some exceptional cases, the code has leaks.

### V2

I fix all the problems, that the program had. And added new cast. Also I implement the code in different way instead of having only one list for the basket's users and the products's category, I created one list for each user or category, this makes the program bigger but faster, and in my opinion better.


Please note that all of the code is still undocumented, and no contribution guidelines are in place.

Contributions are welcome, just beware of the dragons. üê≤
