PROJECT 1

The principal is create a platform were different users can buy and sell different products.

So, following the tips and help of my schoolmates, I decide to make it with new variable that we have seen with Alfonso, arrayList. I think that works well, but in some exceptinal cases has leaks.

The program is form by two principal menus:
User's menu
