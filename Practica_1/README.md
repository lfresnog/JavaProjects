PROJECT 1

The principal is create a platform were different users can buy and sell different products.
I started this idea trought the implementation of arrays, but when i tried to link it with my users give me problems, also the use of arrays make the code too big and complicated. So, following the tips and help of my schoolmates, I decide to make it with new variable that we have seen with Alfonso, arrayList. I think that works well, but in some exceptinal cases has leaks.

The program is form by two principal menus:

-- User's menu --
